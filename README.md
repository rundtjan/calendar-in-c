Clone repository, cd into folder and (in linux) run 'make run' (you will need to have 'make' installed from before). This will run the app.  
Command "A <description> 1 2 3" will enter an event with name "description" on January 2nd at 3 a.m.  
Command "D 1 2 3" would delete the same entry.  
Command "L" will list all entries.  
Command "W <name of file>" will write all entries to a txt-file.  
Command "O <name of file>" would open a file with correct format.  
Command "Q" will exit the app.
